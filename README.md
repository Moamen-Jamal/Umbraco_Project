# Umbraco_Project
In this project, I added lots of compositions and to know how to use different property editors, and I sliced up the template to create the master template, home page and content page template. We use partial views for the header, footer, latest articles and navigation. In addition, I made Nested Content Navigation, and Block List data type with different features like Carousel, Accordion and Quote Rows. Then, I added parent and Child contents using list view like Contact Us Form. Finally, I used Umbraco Forms to make Survey and use the benefits of the Umbraco Form.
